        <!--Problem solving is the most important part of being a programmer, program
            languages and knowledge are only tools to meet that end.
            The first step in solving a problem is understanding the problem, otherwise
            you wouldn't ever know if the problem has been solved.
            Once you understand the problem the second step is to plan how you'll solve it.
            This means answering questions about your product/program's use cases.
            Does your website need a User Interface? Do user's need to log in? 
            What functions should your program have? What inputs? What should the output
            be?
            Once you've planned out your needs, write your solution into pseudocode.
            Pseudocode is writing out explicitly what each line of code for a solution
            would do, in plain english. For instance:
                1 take user input as string
                2 initialize a variable to store user input
                3 replace the first character with the last character and vice versa
                4 store converted string into variable
                5 print the converted string back to the user
            Building a website or developing a software solution is typically a long
            complex process, as such you're problem doesn't often have a simple
            solution. It's best practice to break down your problem into smaller
            problems and solve those in order to get the overall solution.
            Trying to solve one big complex problem can lead to getting caught up
            in developing the wrong solution, or having conflicting code, causing a
            lot of frustration.
                
            You'll know when you understand a problem when you can explain it explicitly.

            How to think like a programmer
                programming isnt completely about languages, syntax, math or any
                of the technical aspects of the skill. It's more about how you use these
                things to SOLVE PROBLEMS. It's about thinking about how you'll incorporate
                these things into your solutions. Don't make the mistake of learning and memorizing
                all of the syntax and best practices without practicing how to incorporate
                them into your work.

                consider creating a new variable, what does the variable represent?
                What kind of data should it store? does it's data type even matter?
                Should it have an initial value?

                Once you know the answer to these questions you can create meaningful variables.

                What about output and input? What do you want to show the user? what information do
                you want from a user? even this requires consideration. 

                considering a codes funcionality and being able to write out in simple terms, makes
                it easier to convert into code later.

                Failure means that you're trying, it's an opportunity to grow. Begin debugging, 
                did you write code incorrectly, did you tell your code to do the wrong thing?

                Debugging can be complicated when you don't understand the problem your trying to solve.
                Problems in your code can range from a syntax problem to bad implementation. 
                If you're implementation is bad, it means you don't have a good grasp of your problem.
                This mean that your implementation may not even be the correct solution. So you'll
                spend time debugging an implementation that was set to fail from the start.
                The best way to debug is to avoid bugs to begin with, especially with your implementation.

                IN the case of considering for loops and while loops, there are a lot of prerequisite
                conditions to be met before constructing a loop.
                IN a for loop you have an integer variable that controls the loops, this variable 
                should be initialized at the beginning, and should change every time the loop repeats.
                Until you reach the end value.

                Not understanding how this works could lead to problems with satisfying your conditions.
                Which most often happens with a while loop.
                While loops only take one parameter, the condition for the loop to continue repeating.
                Which means that you have to initialize the condition outside of the while loop, and then
                somehow write your code so that you'll again trigger the condition withing the while
                loop so that it breaks. If you never trigger that condition you'll always be stuck
                inside a while loop. So you have to write good logic so that you dont get stuck.

                How to Write Pseudocode
                    Always capitalize the initial word (often one of the main six constructs).
                    Make only one statement per line.
                    Indent to show hierarchy, improve readability and show nested constructs.
                    Always end multi-line sections using any of the END keywords (ENDIF, ENDWHILE, etc.).
                    Keep your statements programming language independent.
                    Use the naming domain of the problem, not that of the implementation. 
                    For instance: “Append the last name to the first name” instead of “name = first+last.”
                    Keep it simple, concise and readable.
