    <!-- Code with errors can still run, but the compiler will throw an error.
            A Reference Error gets thrown when referencing a variable that is undefined
            Normally the error will tell you where in your code the error was thrown.
            So A Reference error will tell you what variable caused the error and
            what file and line the error was thrown.
            
            Errors that have occured deep into your code will have a Stack Trace, the
            stack trace shows all of the functions that led up to the line where the error
            was thrown.
            
            Syntax errors are exactly as they sound, they occur when you've typed incorrect
            syntax.
            
            Type error, A TypeError may be thrown when using the wrong data type, or 
            attempting to modify the value of an immutable variable. For instance when
            using an Array function 'push()' with a string variable, a typeError will
            be thrown
            
            To Debug an error you must understand the error to know where to begin.
